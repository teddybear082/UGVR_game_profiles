Welcome to the CRUEL VR alpha!

KNOWN ISSUES:
-In game VR menu (hold primary hand up to head and press trigger) seems not to be working right so avoid it for now. Under investigation.

-Controller remapping only appears to be partially working, in that all VR controls map as intended, but it appears some of the original game's joypad controls remain mapped too. (Example, VR kick button is also triggering melee).  Under investigation.

-I can't seem to turn off the game's mapping of turning on the right stick.  So it's best to turn in real life if you can because turning with the right stick may also wind up moving your kick leg up and down (you'll know this happened if you can't kick a door, try moving the right stick up and down until it works)

-Sometimes the mesh on melee weapons doubles or triples up over time. I have code that is supposed to delete these but for some reason they seem to stay in there. Under investigation.

-After dying at some point your menu will no longer display text in game for the death menu. Not sure why this happens.  Just press your left stick down a couple times and press A and it will go back to the main menu.


CONTROLS:

--Regular game menus--

Operate menu with left joystick, press A (lower face button) on right controller to select options.

Click right stick in and then click left stick to emulate a start button press to pause the game.




--Gameplay--

Bring up hand radial menu: click and hold right thumb stick

Control hand radial menu: while thumb is placed on right thumb stick, hover over the option you want to choose (reload, revolver, uzi, shotgun) and then release your thumb stick.  Note that gun selections will only activate once you acquire a new gun.

Jump: Right controller A (lower face button)

Crouch: Left thumbstick click

Shoot: Right trigger

Kick: Left trigger

Throw melee: Left controller Y (top face button) + Right stick click

Heal: (drink soda can once you have one): Right controller top face button (B/Y) -HOLD until soda can is empty

Reload: (alternative to radial menu): Right controller grip

Sprint: Left Controller grip

Dog screen after level: After the level you may find yourself looking at black darkness.  Turn around.  You will then see a dog and two doors.  Use your left thumbstick left/right to choose the available options (gamble, feed me (only if you have a soda - earn a perk) and progress (go to next level)).
