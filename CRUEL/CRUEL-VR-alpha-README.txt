Welcome to the CRUEL VR alpha!

KNOWN ISSUES:
-I can't seem to turn off the game's mapping of turning on the right stick.  So it's best to turn in real life if you can because turning with the right stick may also wind up moving your kick leg up and down (you'll know this happened if you can't kick a door, try moving the right stick up and down until it works)

-Sometimes the mesh on melee weapons doubles or triples up over time. I have code that is supposed to delete these but for some reason they seem to stay in there. Under investigation.

-After dying at some point your menu will no longer display text in game for the death menu. Not sure why this happens.  Just press your left stick down a couple times and press A and it will go back to the main menu.

-Sometimes game will crash on pressing "restart" on the menu after you die, you may just have to go back to the main menu or restart.

Dog screen after level: After the level you may find yourself looking at black darkness.  Turn around.  You will then see a dog and two doors.  Use your left thumbstick left/right to choose the available options (gamble, feed me (only if you have a soda - earn a perk) and progress (go to next level)).
