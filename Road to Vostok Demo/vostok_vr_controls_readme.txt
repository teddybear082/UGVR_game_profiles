Special things about vostok VR controls:

Add a shortcut to your game folder for the game exe and in shortcut properties, target, add --main-pack Injector.pck

IMPORTANT: When you get in game you wont be able to move.  Load the VR controls by raising your secondary hand to your head and pressing the top face button (B/Y).


OTHER TIPS:

Your UI will be on your secondary hand.

You can see the virtual keybinds in the XRConfigs/road_to_vostok_game_action_map.cfg file.

Certain actions are bound to your hand radial menu, which you bring up by pressing in on the thumbstick of your primary hand and hovering over the option you want, then releasing the thumbstick

Item picking is controlled by an invisible beam that extends from  your secondary hand.  Press the secondary controller grip to select an item, and hold secondary controller  trigger to physically pick up eligible items and move them.

Vostok require an "aim" button to be pressed, unfortunately, to shoot your weapon. For now I have this on the primary controller grip button.  So to shoot a gun you have to hold down the grip on your primary controller and then pull the trigger on your gun/primary controller.  

Vostok requires you to equip weapons in the inventory menu before using them (virtual start button - hold down primary thumbstick and press secondary thumbstick, then use your pointer to click on the guns and put them in your primary and secondary hand)

Vostok also requires you to have ammo and for you to reload the weapon before you can shoot them.  To reload use your wrist radial menu.

If you want to, you can swing your arms in a running motion to sprint instead of using the sprint keybind and thumbstick.

If you want to, you can swing both of your arms from low to high at the same time to perform a jump instead of pressing the jump button.

To "right click" on an item in a menu for instance for crafting or to install a weapon addon, press primary controller A/X button.

To turn off your pointer (which you should do whenever youre not in a menu, hold primary controller to your head and press trigger.  Do the same thing to bring it back.

Remember Vostok itself is in beta right now so not everything will work now, also for now I cannot bind the item use button or the button to swim.  I imagine in a future beta that they will make that bindable to an action.
